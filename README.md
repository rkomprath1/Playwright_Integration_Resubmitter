Runs a batch every 30 minutes with each batch containing a set amount of dealerships. Waits 20 seconds per dealership prior to proceeding with next dealership. If there are 4 batches of 250 dealerships each, it will go through all batches, and start at the first batch once the final batch has been completed. It will run continuously throughout the day. Considering using Python to launch the batches instead, and in the case of failure the Python script will re-launch the script. It will achieve this by verifying the Chromium process is running.
